    question: 'It can run shell commands. How is that safe?',
    answer:
      'Writes, sends, and shell commands are approval-gated by default: the app shows the exact action and waits. A folder also has to be trusted before its own command allowances count, and unattended runs park their questions in an inbox instead of deciding on their own.',

    question: 'How do I know what a session costs?',
    answer:
      'The composer tracks the tokens a session has spent, and long conversations are compacted automatically so context stays affordable. Every call is metered against your BoxAI account, so it also shows up in your usage logs.',
